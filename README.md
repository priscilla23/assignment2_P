CNVRS8 APP
=============
CNVRS8 is a simple chat application
CSS and HTML files are generated by the Index.sass and the index.jade files. 

How to use: create the index jade file and make a div that will contain the message box where the messages will be displayed. The 'send' button has a click event, so once the user has typed their message in and pressed 'send' the function will run and display the text in the message box.
